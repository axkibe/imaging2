  /** \ingroup shape 
      \brief Abstract class interface for shapes on a shape parameter manifold.
      
      This class interface defines shapes, which are determined by parameters on a Riemannian manifold. I.e. every shape implements the Riemannian exponential which maps vectors to a shape in its neighborhood. The Riemannian logarithm maps shapes in this neighborhood back to its Riemannian coordinates with respect to the reference shape. If we denote the Riemannian manifold as \f$M\f$ then every shape \f$p\f$ has to implement
      \f[
      \textrm{Exp}_p: T_pM \rightarrow M
      \f]
      and
      \f[
      \textrm{Log}_p: M \rightarrow T_pM
      \f]
      
      The following example shows how this enables computations with shapes without the knowledge of details about the shape implementation. It computes the Riemannian logarithm with respect to the first shape of each of the remaining shapes. Then the mean of the logarithms is computed and mapped back to a shape. The function is fully generic, i.e. it does not know what the actual shapes it processes are.
      
  \code
  template <class shape_t>
  void compute_mean(const std::vector<shape_t> & shapes, shape_t & mean_shape)
  {
    if(shapes.size() == 0)
      return;
      
    std::vector< ublas::vector<float_t> > logarithms(shapes.size() - 1);
    ublas::vector<float_t> logarithm_of_mean;
      
    shape_t & reference_shape = shapes[0]; // create an alias for the first shape
                                           // we call it reference_shape
                                           
    logarithm_of_mean = ublas::scalar_vector(reference_shape.dimension(), 0.0);
    // set the vector which will be the logarithm of the mean shape to zero
    
    ublas::vector<float_t> logarithm(reference_shape.dimension());
    // will hold the logarithm of each shape in the loop below
    
    for(size_t i = 1; i < shapes.size(); ++i)
    {
      reference_shape.logarithm(shapes[i], logarithm); // computes the logarithm
      logarithm_of_mean += logarithm; // adds it to the scaled mean
    }
    
    logarithm_of_mean /= float_t(shapes.size()); // scales the mean correctly
    
    reference_shape.exponential(logarithm_of_mean, mean_shape);
    // computes the shape determined by logarithm_of_mean
