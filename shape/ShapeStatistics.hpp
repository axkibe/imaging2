  /** \ingroup shape
      \brief Computes the mean shape and the covariance of a shape distribution and samples from this distribution.
      
      This class computes the mean shape and the covariance in the tangent space at the mean shape of a set of shapes. In addition, it is possible to manually set parameters of the distribution (such as position and rotation) to remove dependence of the statistics on them. After the computation of the statistics the user can sample shapes from a normal distribution on the tangent space of the mean shape. The covariance matrix of this distribution is the same as the one of the sample data (with exception of the manually set modes).
      
      The shapes must be elements of a common shape manifold, i.e. \em shape_t must be derived from ShapeInterface and the Riemannian exponential and logarithm of the shapes must be compatible to each other. More precisely, all shapes passed to a ShapeStatistics object must accept all the others as arguments in their exponential and logarithm member functions.
      
      Note that the user must call compute_statistics() before querying a ShapeStatistic object, i.e. before calling mean_shape() or any of the sample members.
