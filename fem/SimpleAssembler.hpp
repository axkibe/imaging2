      \brief Assembles the stiffness matrix and force vector of a FE problem implementing SimpleEquationInterface.
      
      The SimpleAssembler class provides functions to assemble the stiffness matrix and force vector for a given equation and a given grid.
      In contrast to Assembler, SimpleAssembler requires the equation to implement SimpleEquationInterface.

    /** Assembles the stiffness matrix and the force vector for \em simple_equation on \em grid. This is done in one big loop and thus faster than calling assemble_stiffness_matrix() and assemble_force_vector() separately. For performance reasons the type of \em simple_equation is a template parameter.
    
        The class \em simple_equation_t must implement all the functions defined in SimpleEquationInterface. It is also advised to derive \em simple_equation_t from SimpleEquationInterface.
    
        The sparse matrix \em stiffness_matrix must be square and its size equal to the total number of nodes of the grid, as obtained from Grid::n_nodes(). It can greatly improve the performance of this function, if the matrix is pre-filled with zeros at positions where non-zero entries are expected. The position of the non-zeros entries depend on the geometry of the FE problem. Some grid construction functions provide an appropriate pre-filling of the stiffness matrix.
