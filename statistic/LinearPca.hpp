      \brief Linear principal component analysis.
      
      This class computes a (linear) principal component analysis (PCA) of given data. It provides functions to retrieve the standard deviations of the data within the principal components and to compute the PCA coefficients of vectors and vice-versa.
      
      A LinearPCA object is always set to some current data and a current dimension, either by passing the data and the dimension to the constructor or by calling set_data(). All member functions refer to the current data at the current dimension. The default dimension is the data dimension, i.e. the number of columns of the data matrix.
